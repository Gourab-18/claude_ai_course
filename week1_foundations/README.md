# Week 1: Foundations & Data Mastery

Welcome to Week 1 of the Machine Learning Course! This week focuses on building a solid foundation in Python for data science and machine learning.

## Overview

| Day | Topic | Key Skills |
|-----|-------|------------|
| 1 | Foundations & Environment Setup | ML types, Environment setup, Basic data exploration |
| 2 | NumPy Fundamentals | Arrays, Broadcasting, Vectorization |
| 3 | Pandas Data Manipulation | DataFrames, Data cleaning, Groupby operations |
| 4 | Data Visualization | Matplotlib, Seaborn, EDA |
| 5 | Statistics for ML | Descriptive stats, Probability, Hypothesis testing |

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Willingness to learn!

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv ml_env

# Activate it
# On Linux/Mac:
source ml_env/bin/activate
# On Windows:
ml_env\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Daily Assignments

### Day 1 Assignment
Write 200 words on "What ML problem do I want to solve?"

### Day 2 Assignment
Create a 10x10 matrix, normalize it, and extract specific patterns

### Day 3 Assignment
Clean a messy dataset (remove duplicates, handle missing values, create new features)

### Day 4 Assignment
Perform EDA on Titanic dataset with 10+ visualizations

### Day 5 Assignment
Analyze correlation between features in a dataset, test a hypothesis

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. **Understand ML fundamentals**: Differentiate between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
2. **Work with NumPy**: Create, manipulate, and perform operations on arrays efficiently
3. **Master Pandas**: Load, clean, transform, and analyze datasets
4. **Create visualizations**: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful data visualizations
5. **Apply statistics**: Use statistical methods to understand data and test hypotheses

## Tips for Success

1. **Practice daily**: Each concept builds on the previous one
2. **Complete all assignments**: They reinforce the day's learning
3. **Experiment**: Try modifying the code examples
4. **Ask questions**: If something is unclear, investigate further
